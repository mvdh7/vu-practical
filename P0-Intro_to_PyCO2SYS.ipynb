    "\n",
    "PyCO2SYS is a Python package that allows us to solve the marine carbonate system.  That means that from any pair of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) or one of its components, total alkalinity, pH, CO₂ partial pressure or fugacity, you can calculate all the rest of these parameters, and other variables relevant to seawater CO₂ chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first notebook introduces you to PyCO2SYS and how to use it.  You don't need to make any specific changes to the code in this section, although you should try out making some adjustments to make sure you understand how it works.  For example, you could try:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Adding in the effects of additional nutrients,\n",
    "  * Changing which pair of carbonate system parameters are provided,\n",
    "  * Finding the values of a few different calculated properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only function you need is `pyco2.sys`, and as a minimum you need values for two of the marine carbonate system parameters in the list above:"
